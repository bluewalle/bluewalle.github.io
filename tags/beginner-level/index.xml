      <description>This series of walkthroughs aims to help out complete beginners with finishing the Pre Security Path on the TryHackMe (thm)1 website.
Please note, that by no means does this writeup replace the original room, and it&amp;rsquo;s content. It is only meant as a support material in case one is stuck, and need a little bit of help.
As you might have already noticed, this path requires no prior knowledge, and therefore no such prerequisites are set forth.</description>
